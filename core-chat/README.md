A simple API with user, chat, and chat message management.

Built to the API spec defined [here](http://docs.oracodechallenge.apiary.io/#reference/endpoints).

## Requirements

- .NET Core v1.0.0.

## TODO

This is a bit of a toy example, so note the following potential enhancements:

- Hash and salt passwords (MUST HAVE)
- Enable and force HTTPS (MUST HAVE)
- Use Entity Framework for model persistence (currently using in-memory storage)
- Better auth integration (bearer token solution felt a bit hacky)
- More defensive programming
